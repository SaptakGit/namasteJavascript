1. "this" in global scope always points to the globalObject (globalObject depends on javascript runtime env)
2. "this" in a function depends on 2 things
    a. strict / non strict mode (in strict mode, "this" is undefined, in non strict mode, "this substitution" takes place and "this" points to globalObject)
    b. how the function is being invoked (if we invoke the function using the global object in strict mode, then "this" will point to that globalObject)
3. "this" in a method always points to the object that is used to invoke the method.
4. call, apply & bind are used to share a method with another object (hence the "this" keyword reference would also change accordingly)
5. "this" inside arrow function refers to the enclosing lexical context
6. "this" in DOM points to the HTML element itself on which it is being used


All these methods are used for method/function borrowing or sharing.
- call method is used to call the function with the given this value and arguments can be passed individually.
printFullName.call(student, "Jammu", "J&K");
- apply method is similar to call, the only difference is that instead of passing the arguments indvidually we pass the arguments in a list/array.
printFullName.apply(student, ["Jammu", "J&K"]);
- bind method is also used to override the this value but unlike call and apply it does not invoke the function instantly but returns a function with attached this and arguments which can be called later.
const printStudent = printFullName.bind(student, "Udhampur", "J&K");
printStudent();
