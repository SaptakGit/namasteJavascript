"Execution Context"
	a) Memory Component(variable Environment) => all the variable and functions are stored as key:value pair
	
	b) Code Component(Thred of Execution) => here all the code executed one line at a time
	
"JavaScript is a synchronous single-threaded language"

phase 1:
memory creation phase:
	js allocates memory to variable and functions
	variable = as Undefined
	functions = the whole function code 
		
phase 2:
code execution phase:
	variable = set the given value of variable in code
	in case of function call it creates another execution context with only the indise part of the function. and repezt the process of phase 1 and phase 2.
	
	
all the execution cantext are kept in a call stack.
the main (global) is at bottom. onec the execution is done it removes from the stack.

JavaScript Hoist

if a JS file is empty(sortest JS function) it still js creates a window(in case of browser).
window = it a global object along with a global execution context. here we have all the functions that are provided by JS Engine to us for use	

here the "this" is point to this window
this === window = True

JS is a loosly(weekly) type language:
it does not attach its variable to any particular data type. we can store any type of data in it

Scope in JS is directely directly related with Lexical Environment

Lexical = in heirarchy
Lexical Environment is the local memory along with the 
Lexical Environment of its parent

Scope Chain is the process where we look for a varable or function in its Lexical Environment and Lexical Environment of its parent if it is not found n the local Execution Context menory

let and const are hoisted but they are in the Temporal Dead Zone for the Time being

let and const are also hoisted(allocated memory) but in separate memory space. It can not be accress untill we put some value in it.it will give referance error.

temporala dead zone: the time between when the let/const variable is hoisted  to the time it is initialised with some value.

redeclaration/ duplication of let is not possible. it will give a syntax error.

const can not initialised later.It will give us a syntax error.it has to be initialised at time of declaration.

re-initialisation of const gives a type error

Type error
Syntax error
Referance Error

block:{} is called a block. it is also called Compound Statement. The {} used to group multiple java script statement.

 the block is used where java script expects a single statement.
 
block scoped: what are all the variable and function we can access inside this block.

let and const are hoisted inside the block scope if they are defind inside {}. where as var is hoisted in global scope.

once the work of {} (block) is done the block scope is deleted.so let and const can not be access from outside {}. but var can be access since it is in global scope.

shadowing
illigal shadowing

block scope also follow lexical scope


Closure :Function bundled with its lexical environment is known as a closure. Whenever function is returned, even if its vanished in execution context but still it remembers the reference it was pointing to. Its not just that function alone it returns but the entire closure and that's where it becomes interesting


setTimeout Problem with colsure:
print 1 to 5 each after 1 sec delay =>

function y(){
    for(var i=1;i<=5;i++){
        setTimeout(function(){ 
            console.log(i);
        },i*1000);
    }
    console.log("Namaster JS");
}
y();

        setTimeout(function(){ 
            console.log(i);
        },i*1000);

    console.log("Namaster JS");

Sol 2:
function y(){

		function close(j){
			setTimeout(function(){ 
				console.log(j);
			},j*1000);
		}
        return close(i)

Function Statement:
	function a(){
		console.log("a called")
	}
	this way of creating a function is called function statement

Function Expression:
	var b = function(){
		console.log("b called")
	}
this way of creating a function is called function Expression

Diff Statement and Expression:
	The main differance is Hoisting
	if a() and b() are called before declaration. a() will run as it is treated as a function at time of memory creation but b is breated as a variable and assinged as undefined and thus will throws a type error.

Function Declaration:
	Function Statement are also known as Function Declaration.
	
Anonymous Function:
	A function without a name is an Anonymous Function.
	function(){
		
	}
	It is used when they are used as values. Like Function Expression. It can not be used as Function Statement. It will throw syntax error.
	
Named Function Expression:
	IT is same as Function Expression but with a Named Function not an Anonymous Function.
	var b = function xyz(){
		console.log("b called")
	}
	
	Corner Case:
		calling xyz() -> referance error
		it is not a function in the outer scope. but it is created as a local variable. so it can not be access from outside.
		
Difference between Parameters and Arguments:
	function abc(param1, param2){
	
	}
	param1, param2 ->local variable	
	
	abc(arg1, arg2) -> arguments
	
First Class Function:
	The ability to use functions as values is named as First Class Function.We can pass Named/Anonymous Function as Arguments into a Function and also return Named/Anonymous functions from a Function.This is called as First Class Function.
	It is also called First Class Citizens.
	
	
What is Callback Function in JavaScript?
	The function which is passed as an argument in a Function and called later is known as Callback Function.It gives us access to Asynchronus Operation.
	
Blocking the main thread:
	If a piece of code thake too much time to execute, it create a blockage to the main thread/main call stack, sice javascript in a single threaded language. This can be reduce by doing long execution with Asynchronus Operation.
	
Event Listener:
	Event Listener are Callback Functions that are invoke by an Event.
	
Garbage Collection & removeEventListeners:
	eventListeners are heavy, it takes memory. They form a closure. So the call stack may be empty but they hold onto their Lexical values.
	
Web APIs:
	SetTimeout()
	DOM APIs(document.things...)
	fetch()
	local Storage
	console
	location
	
	These are not part of javascript. Browser provide us these to access inside js engine/call stack with the help of the global object 'window'.It raps up all the web api into the global object 'window'.
	
When a callback function is happen it does not directly to the call stack. It first put into a callback queue. then the Event Loop puts the callback function from Callback Queue to Call Stack.

Event Loop:
	Its only job is to continuously monitor the Callback Queue and the Call Stack.When ever it see the call stack is empty and a callback function in callback queue it puts the callback function into the call stack.

Micro task queue:
	It is same as callback queue but with higher priority.
	
All the callback function which comes through promises will go inside the microtask queue.

Starvation of Callback Queue

Javascript Runtime Environment:
	It has Js Engine, Web APIs, Callback Queue, Microtast Queue, Event Loop.
	Js Engine is the heart of Javascript Runtime Environment
	
a JS Engine shloud follw ECMAScript language standard.

Brandan Eick created Javascript and also the first js engine known as spider monkey(now use as js engine in mozila)

Javascript Engine Architechture:
	Parsing:
		first it break down the js code into tokens
		then the 'Syntax Parser' parse the whole code and converts it into AST (Advanced Syntax Tree).(https://astexplorer.net/)
		
	Compilation:
		Interpretter ->Fast
		Compiler -> Efficient
		JS is besically an Interpretter. But most of the mordern Browser use JIT Compiler
		JIT(Just In Time) Compilation:
			It is Interpretter along with a compiler.
			
			optimizing process:
				inlining
				copy eligian
				inline caching
			
		The Interpretter starts to interpret the AST and convert it into machine level language at the same time the compiler tries to optimize the AST in run time convert it into machine level language which later executed.
			
	Execution:
		Memory Heap:
			IT is the space where all the variable and functions assigned memory.
			
			garbadge Collector: it tries to free up memory space whenever possible. It uses an algorithm call 'Mark & Sweep'
		Call Stack
		
Fastest Engine V8
	Iterpertter name is 'Ignition'
	Optimizing Compiler is 'Turbo Fan'
	Gabadge Collector is 'Orinoco','Oilpalm'
	
setTimeout does not always execute after the given time.If the call stack is full and a global execution context is running in the call stack the setTimeout callback will wait in callback queue and wait untill tue call is empty.This is known as 'Concurrency Model' in javascript.

Functional Programming is not posible with out Higher order Function.
Higher order Function:
	A function which takes another function as an argument or returns a function from it is known as higher order function.
